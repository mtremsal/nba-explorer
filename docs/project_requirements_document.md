# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a free website that lets users explore the complete NBA database, including teams, players, and games. The data is stored locally in a SQLite file, and the whole application is built entirely using Python and Flask. The design and layout are inspired by the official NBA website, making it familiar for fans. Users can browse comprehensive lists with full details available on separate pages when they click on an item.

The idea is being built to give enthusiasts and casual browsers an easy and attractive way to access detailed NBA data without any authentication or account hassles. Success for this project means an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing site that efficiently displays all relevant information with built-in search and filtering for ease of use. The key objective is to provide a reliable, self-contained, and containerized web application that can be easily hosted and maintained on a VPS.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Homepage with navigation links to teams, players, and games sections.
*   Dedicated listing pages for teams, players, and games displaying complete data from the SQLite database in tabulated formats.
*   Detail pages for individual teams, players, and games showing all associated data.
*   Integrated search and filtering functionality across all listing pages.
*   Design and styling inspired by the official NBA website, ensuring a polished and professional look.
*   Backend implemented with vanilla Flask, using Python as the sole programming language.
*   Complete packaging of the application (code and local SQLite database) into a single container for deployment on a VPS.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Any user authentication or account management features.
*   Advanced analytics, real-time data updates, or third-party API integrations.
*   Mobile-specific layout adjustments beyond responsive design basics.
*   Advanced animations or dynamic front-end frameworks beyond basic HTML and CSS.
*   External database management (only the local SQLite file is used).

## 3. User Flow

When a new visitor lands on the website, they are greeted with a simple homepage that serves as the central hub. The homepage provides clear buttons or links to navigate to the Teams, Players, and Games pages. Users can quickly click through to the listing of their desired data category while enjoying a familiar look that mirrors the official NBA website. Once on a listing page, they can use provided search and filtering tools to narrow down the large dataset.

After filtering or browsing the list, the user can click on any specific item such as a team, player, or game. This action takes them to a dedicated detail page where every data field related to the item is displayed. These detail pages include navigational aids like "Back" buttons, ensuring users can easily return to the main list or continue exploring other sections. The overall flow is designed to be intuitive and seamless, allowing users to find detailed information with minimal effort.

## 4. Core Features (Bullet Points)

*   **Navigation and Homepage:**

    *   Centralized homepage that offers navigational links to teams, players, and games listings.
    *   Design inspired by the official NBA website for immediate aesthetic recognition.

*   **Database Browsing:**

    *   Listing pages for teams, players, and games that pull all relevant data from a local SQLite database.
    *   Data presented in easy-to-read tabulated formats.

*   **Search and Filtering:**

    *   Built-in search functionality for quickly locating specific teams, players, or games.
    *   Robust filtering options to help users narrow down large datasets based on various criteria.

*   **Detail Views:**

    *   Dedicated detail pages for each item (team, player, or game) that display complete data fields.
    *   Easy-to-use navigation for returning back to the listing pages.

*   **Containerized Deployment:**

    *   Entire application (Flask code and SQLite database) packaged into a single container.
    *   Simplifies hosting on a VPS and ensures a reproducible deployment environment.

*   **Design and Branding:**

    *   Visual structure and user interface reflecting the design cues of the official NBA website.
    *   Consistent styling across all pages and interactive elements.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   HTML for structure and content.
    *   CSS for styling and layout, mimicking the NBA website's branding.

*   **Backend:**

    *   Python as the primary language.
    *   Flask (vanilla) as the web framework to handle routing and page rendering.
    *   SQLite as the database for storing NBA data.

*   **Deployment & Containerization:**

    *   Docker (or similar containerization tool) to package the complete application into a single deployable container.

*   **Development Tools:**

    *   VS Code as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
    *   Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AI-assisted code suggestions and development support.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   Fast response times with minimal load times on each page.
    *   Efficient database queries to handle search and filtering without lag.

*   **Security:**

    *   Basic security best practices to protect the data locally stored in SQLite.
    *   Containerized deployment to isolate the application environment and reduce external vulnerabilities.

*   **Usability:**

    *   Intuitive navigation and user experience similar to the NBA website.
    *   Mobile-responsive design to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Ensure all code follows standard Python and Flask best practices.
    *   Utilize appropriate error handling and logging to simplify debugging and future maintenance.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The application will be built entirely using Python with Flask; no other programming languages or frameworks will be involved.
*   The NBA database is stored in a local SQLite file, which is assumed to be properly structured and maintained offline.
*   The final product is containerized, assuming availability of containerization tools (e.g., Docker) and a VPS for hosting.
*   Development will use VS Code along with extensions that integrate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet for code assistance.
*   The design will closely mimic the official NBA website, assuming there are no licensing or intellectual property conflicts.
*   It is assumed that the target audience prefers a simple, straightforward browsing experience without the need for user logins or complex interactions.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Database Performance:**

    *   Since SQLite is used and the dataset might grow, queries for search and filtering should be optimized. Mitigation: Use proper indexing and keep queries simple.

*   **Containerization Complexity:**

    *   Packaging both the code and the local database into a single container can pose challenges if database updates are needed. Mitigation: Ensure the container is designed to allow database persistence or easier updates.

*   **Design Consistency:**

    *   Mimicking the NBA websiteâ€™s branding exactly might be challenging due to design nuances. Mitigation: Focus on capturing the overall look and feel rather than pixel-perfect replication.

*   **Scaling and Future Enhancements:**

    *   Currently, the application does not include authentication or third-party integrations, which might be required later. Mitigation: Design modularly so that future features can be added without a major overhaul of the architecture.

*   **Tool Dependencies:**

    *   Relying on specific tools (VS Code, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) may restrict flexibility if a change is needed. Mitigation: The codebase should remain clean and documented to allow easy transition or incorporation of alternative tools if required.

This PRD is intended to provide clear guidelines for creating a free, fully Python-based website that offers comprehensive NBA data browsing with a user-friendly interface, search and filtering features, and robust containerized deployment. All subsequent technical documents should align with this foundation.
