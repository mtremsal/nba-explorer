# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Prevalidation**: Check if the current directory is already a project (e.g., verify if key folders like `/templates`, `/static`, and `/data` already exist) before initializing a new project. (Project Goal)
2. **Tool Check**: Verify that Python is installed by running `python --version` in the terminal. (Tech Stack: Backend)
3. **Directory Structure**: Create the following directories in the project root if they do not already exist:
   - `/templates` (for HTML templates)
   - `/static` (for CSS and other static assets)
   - `/data` (to store the local SQLite database)
   - `/backend` (for backend code, if desired, else use project root for `app.py`)
   (Project Goal, Tech Stack: Frontend & Backend)
4. **Configuration Files**: Create a `requirements.txt` in the project root to list Python dependencies. Add at minimum:
   - Flask
   (Tech Stack: Backend)
5. **Containerization Setup**: Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root. (Deployment: Containerized Deployment)

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

6. **Homepage Template**: Create `/templates/index.html` containing the NBA-inspired homepage design. It should include navigation links to Teams, Players, and Games sections. (Project Goal: Homepage)
7. **Teams Listing Page**: Create `/templates/teams.html` with a table structure to display team data and include search/filter fields. (Project Goal: Listing Pages)
8. **Players Listing Page**: Create `/templates/players.html` with a table structure to display player data along with search and filtering elements. (Project Goal: Listing Pages)
9. **Games Listing Page**: Create `/templates/games.html` with a table structure for game data and integrated search options. (Project Goal: Listing Pages)
10. **Team Detail Page**: Create `/templates/team_detail.html` to display all data fields for a selected team with a link to return to the teams listing. (Project Goal: Detail Pages)
11. **Player Detail Page**: Create `/templates/player_detail.html` to display full details for a selected player with navigation back to the listing. (Project Goal: Detail Pages)
12. **Game Detail Page**: Create `/templates/game_detail.html` to display complete game information with navigation back to the listing. (Project Goal: Detail Pages)
13. **CSS Styling**: Create `/static/styles.css` with NBA-inspired design elements. Reference branding colors and layout similar to the official NBA website, ensuring responsiveness. (Project Goal: NBA-Inspired Design)
14. **Validation**: Open `index.html` in a web browser locally (using a simple HTTP server, e.g., `python -m http.server`) to ensure the page displays correctly and navigation links are visible.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

15. **Flask App Setup**: Create `app.py` in the project root (or inside `/backend` if preferred) to serve as the main Flask application entry point. (Tech Stack: Backend)
16. **Application Configuration**: In `app.py`, import Flask and initialize the app. (Tech Stack: Backend)
17. **Database Connection**: In `app.py`, set up connection to the local SQLite database located at `/data/nba.db` using Python's `sqlite3` library. (Project Goal, Tech Stack: Backend)
18. **Homepage Route**: Create a route for `/` that renders `index.html`. (App Flow: Homepage)
19. **Teams Listing Route**: Create a route for `/teams` that performs a query on the Teams table in the SQLite database and renders `teams.html` with data. (Project Goal: Listing Pages)
20. **Players Listing Route**: Create a route for `/players` that queries the Players table and renders `players.html`. (Project Goal: Listing Pages)
21. **Games Listing Route**: Create a route for `/games` that retrieves data from the Games table and renders `games.html`. (Project Goal: Listing Pages)
22. **Team Detail Route**: Create a route such as `/teams/<int:team_id>` that queries for a specific team’s details and renders `team_detail.html`. (Project Goal: Detail Pages)
23. **Player Detail Route**: Create a route for `/players/<int:player_id>` that retrieves detailed data for a player and renders `player_detail.html`. (Project Goal: Detail Pages)
24. **Game Detail Route**: Create a route for `/games/<int:game_id>` that retrieves all fields for the selected game and renders `game_detail.html`. (Project Goal: Detail Pages)
25. **Search & Filtering**: Implement search and filtering logic within the listing routes (teams, players, games) to allow querying based on parameters passed via URL query string. (Project Goal: Search & Filtering)
26. **Security Considerations**: Add basic input sanitization for search queries to protect against simple injection attacks. (Non-Functional Requirements: Security)
27. **Validation**: Run the Flask app locally with `python app.py` and test all routes using a browser or tools like Postman to ensure correct data retrieval and display.

## Phase 4: Integration

28. **Template Integration**: In `app.py`, use Flask’s `render_template` function to properly populate HTML templates with data queried from the SQLite database. (App Flow: Homepage, Listing, Detail Pages)
29. **Static Assets Integration**: Link the `/static/styles.css` in all HTML templates to ensure consistent NBA-inspired styling across pages. (Project Goal: NBA-Inspired Design)
30. **Navigation Links**: Ensure all detail pages include a navigation link back to their respective listing pages. (App Flow: Navigation)
31. **Search Form Connection**: Integrate the search form in the listing pages so that it submits GET requests to the same route and display filtered results. (App Flow: Search & Filtering)
32. **Validation**: Navigate through the website locally to ensure that frontend and backend are integrated correctly and all data is displayed as expected.

## Phase 5: Deployment

33. **Dockerfile Creation**: In the `Dockerfile`, begin with an official Python base image (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`). (Deployment: Containerized Deployment)
34. **Copy Files**: Add instructions in the Dockerfile to copy the project files (including `app.py`, `/templates`, `/static`, `/data`, and `requirements.txt`) into the container. (Deployment: Containerized Deployment)
35. **Install Dependencies**: In the Dockerfile, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. (Tech Stack: Backend)
36. **Expose Port**: In the Dockerfile, expose the port that Flask will run on (commonly `5000`). (Deployment: Containerized Deployment)
37. **Startup Command**: In the Dockerfile, specify the command to run the Flask application (e.g., `CMD ["python", "app.py"]`). (Deployment: Containerized Deployment)
38. **Container Build Validation**: Build the Docker image locally with `docker build -t nba-browser .` and verify there are no build errors.
39. **Container Run Validation**: Run the container locally using `docker run -p 5000:5000 nba-browser` and ensure the website is accessible via `http://localhost:5000`. (Non-Functional Requirements: Performance)
40. **VPS Deployment Preparation**: Once validated locally, prepare the container for deployment on your target VPS by ensuring required ports are open and any VPS-specific configurations (like environment variables) are set. (Constraints and Assumptions)

## Final Validation and Testing

41. **End-to-End Test**: Test the complete navigation flow from the homepage, through listing pages, to detail pages. Check search/filter functionalities on listing pages. (App Flow: Entire Navigation)
42. **Performance Check**: Run queries on different pages to ensure fast response times with the local SQLite database. (Non-Functional Requirements: Performance)
43. **UI/Design Validation**: Verify that the site's design closely mimics the NBA website in terms of layout and visual branding without infringing on licensing. (Project Goal: NBA-Inspired Design)
44. **Container Stability Test**: Restart the Docker container and ensure that the SQLite database persists within the container or is accessible as needed. (Potential Pitfalls: Containerization Complexity)

This completes the detailed step-by-step implementation plan for the NBA database browsing website based on the provided project requirements and tech stack.
