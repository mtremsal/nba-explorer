# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
Upon arriving at the website, users are immediately introduced to a clean landing page that clearly reflects the branding and design aesthetic similar to the official NBA website. Since this is a public browsing experience, there is no need for users to sign up or sign in. The landing page itself acts as the gateway to exploring the NBA database, so there are no account creation steps, password recovery forms, or sign-in options. The user experience is streamlined and focused solely on providing access to the data for teams, players, and games.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once users access the website, they are presented with a unified homepage that serves as the central navigational hub. This page displays clear visual elements such as header navigation that includes branded logos and menus and a central section with prominent links to the three main sections: teams, players, and games. In addition to these primary options, the homepage also includes search and filtering options that are consistent across the website, making it easy for the user to locate specific information from the outset. The overall layout follows a simple and modern design, allowing users to jump directly into browsing data without extra distractions.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When a user selects the teams link from the homepage, the application transitions seamlessly to the Teams Listing Page. Here they are presented with a table that contains all the information from the teams table stored in the SQLite database. The user has the option to search and filter through the list using clearly marked input fields styled to match the overall look and feel. Clicking on any individual team takes the user to a dedicated Team Detail Page where every available detail about that team is presented. Navigation aids on the team detail page offer the option to go back to the teams list or to proceed to other sections.

Similarly, when users click on the players option from the homepage, they are directed to the Players Listing Page. This page displays a full listing of NBA players in a neat table format with built-in search and filtering capabilities to help users find a specific player quickly. Clicking on a player’s name navigates the user to a Player Detail Page that shows all the comprehensive details associated with that player’s profile. The design ensures that users can easily return to the full list or navigate to related sections without a hitch.

For users interested in game data, selecting the games link from the homepage loads the Games Listing Page. This page contains a complete record of every game in the SQLite database along with the same ease of search and filter functionalities. Each game record is displayed in a clear, tabulated format. If a user clicks on an individual game from the list, they are taken to a Game Detail Page that provides all available data about that specific game, maintaining a consistent layout with the other detail pages. Navigation elements on all detail pages ensure that users have an easy path to return to the main listing or explore further content.

Across all these listing pages, the search and filtering experience is handled consistently. Users have dynamic input fields that can instantly refine data based on their search terms, and filtering options allow them to quickly adjust the parameters based on criteria such as team names, player positions, or game dates. The transitions between pages are smooth thanks to the simple routing provided by vanilla Flask, ensuring that every click leads to the intended data view without delay or confusion.

## Settings and Account Management
Since the website is designed for public browsing without any need for personalized user accounts, there is no section for settings or account management. There are no prompts for updating personal information, configuring notifications, or managing subscriptions. The simplicity of a public access model means that once users are done exploring or filtering data, they can simply navigate back to the homepage or another section using the clear and consistent navigation elements provided throughout the site.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
The website is built to handle common error states gracefully. If a user enters invalid data into the search or filter fields, the page will display a friendly message indicating that no matching records were found, along with suggestions to modify the query. In the case of an invalid URL or if the detail page requested does not exist (such as passing an incorrect team, player, or game ID), a well-designed error page with clear instructions is shown to help the user navigate back to a valid page. In addition, if there is a temporary loss of connectivity or an unexpected issue with accessing the SQLite database, the website presents a fallback page that informs the user of the issue and advises them to try again later. These error handling measures ensure that regardless of the path taken, the user experience remains smooth and continuous.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The entire journey of the website is designed to be a straightforward exploration of the NBA database. Users begin at a welcoming landing page that frees them from the need to log in or sign up, immediately diving into a simple, clean homepage that consolidates all navigation options. With a strong focus on data accessibility, each section—teams, players, and games—offers comprehensive listings complete with dynamic search and filtering capabilities. Transitioning from summary listings to detail pages is done using clear and familiar navigation patterns, and each step of the process is supported by error handling that maintains a smooth user experience. Ultimately, the app provides a robust and visually appealing platform for users to fully explore all available NBA data, from broad overviews to in-depth details, all built using vanilla Flask and efficiently packaged within a single container for easy deployment on a VPS.
