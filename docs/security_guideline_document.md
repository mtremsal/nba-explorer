# Project Overview

This project is a free website designed for browsing an NBA database, including teams, players, and games. The core functionalities include listing data in a tabulated format with search and filter capabilities, and providing detailed views for each record.

## Key Features

- **Homepage**
  - Displays navigation links to Teams, Players, and Games pages.

- **Listing Pages (Teams, Players, Games)**
  - Retrieve and display all records from the respective SQLite database tables.
  - Provide functionality for searching and filtering records.

- **Detail Pages (Team, Player, Game)**
  - Show comprehensive details for a selected record.
  - Include navigation back to the corresponding listing page.

- **Error Handling**
  - Graceful management of invalid data inputs, URL errors, and database connectivity issues.

- **Containerization**
  - Package the Flask application and SQLite database into a Docker container for deployment on a VPS.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**
  - HTML: Structure and content of the pages.
  - CSS: Styling and layout, inspired by the official [NBA website](https://www.nba.com/).

- **Backend**
  - Python: Main programming language.
  - Flask (vanilla): Web framework used for routing, rendering templates, and handling requests.
  - SQLite: Local database used to store NBA data.

- **Deployment & Containerization**
  - Docker: Used for containerizing the application for deployment on a VPS.

- **Development Tools**
  - VS Code: Primary IDE.
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Code assistant.
  - Git: Version control.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Performance**
  - Ensure fast response times and efficient database queries to handle the NBA data.

- **Security**
  - Implement basic security practices for local SQLite data access.
  - Use containerization to isolate the application and database.

- **Usability**
  - Design intuitive navigation with a mobile-responsive layout to mimic the NBA website's aesthetic.

## Constraints & Assumptions

- The entire application is built using Python with Flask as the web framework.
- The NBA database is a locally stored, well-structured SQLite file.
- Docker is available for containerization, and deployment will occur on a VPS.
- There are no licensing issues related to mimicking the design of the NBA website.

## Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **Database Performance:** Large datasets in SQLite might impact query performance.
- **Containerization Complexity:** Challenges in bundling both code and database into a single, update-friendly container.
- **Design Replication:** Replicating the aesthetics and user experience of the official NBA website could be challenging.

## Security Best Practices Considered

- **Security by Design:** Security measures have been integrated from the initial design phase.
- **Least Privilege:** Components are granted minimum permissions to operate.
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security, including container isolation and error handling, are implemented.
- **Input Validation & Output Encoding:** All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.
- **Fail Securely:** Graceful error handling is in place to avoid exposing sensitive details.
- **Secure Defaults:** The container and Python environment are configured with secure defaults.

This summary serves as a foundational guide for developing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly NBA browsing website using Python, Flask, SQLite, and Docker.
